git pull

git commit -am" the message"

/// It will commit, save your work in the git forverer, i.e. we can go back to this if we want

/// -a mean all the file of the folder is save/commited, -m"" is to write a message so we know if we want to go back to a saved state which one it is. Also it enable others, to follow what you have done more easily

git push

/// upload your local git online, so everyone have your last git (with all it's history)

# in case of conflict
First call Thomas Bienaim√©, as it might be easy.

If you know you didn't do any work and just want to start from what is online do the following

git reset --hard

/// it will reset to the online version, so every work you have not uploaded event if commited locally WILL DISAPEAR

git pull

//// normally now you have the online code
